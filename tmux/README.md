# Tmux Configuration

This is my personal Tmux configuration, designed to create an efficient, aesthetic, and intuitive terminal multiplexer environment.

The core of this setup focuses on usability, featuring a `Ctrl+a` prefix, full mouse support, and Vim-like keybindings for seamless navigation. It also integrates TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager) to manage a suite of powerful plugins that enhance functionality.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Comfortable Prefix**: Changed the default `Ctrl+b` to the easier-to-reach `Ctrl+a`.
- **Vim-style Navigation**: Move between panes seamlessly using `h/j/k/l`.
- **Mouse Mode**: Full support for selecting panes, resizing, and scrolling with the mouse.
- **Aesthetic Status Bar**: A clean, informative status bar showing session name, window list, and current date.
- **Persistent Sessions**: Automatically save and restore your workspace even after a restart, thanks to `tmux-resurrect` and `tmux-continuum`.
- **Enhanced Copying**: Integrated with `tmux-yank` for easy copying to the system clipboard.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Install Tmux**:
    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew install tmux

    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt-get install tmux
    ```

2.  **Install TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager)**:
    Clone the TPM repository to your tmux configuration directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
    ```

3.  **Setup & Install Plugins**:
    - Symlink or copy the `tmux.conf` from this repository to `~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf` or `~/.tmux.conf`.
    - Start Tmux and press **`Prefix + I`** (capital "I") to install all plugins listed in the configuration.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Core Keybindings

Most custom keybindings are designed to reduce keystroke complexity.

**Prefix**: `Ctrl + a`

| Key | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Prefix` `\|` | Split pane horizontally (in current path) |
| `Prefix` `_` | Split pane vertically (in current path) |
| `Prefix` `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` | Move focus to the left/down/up/right pane |
| `Prefix` `Ctrl`+`h`/`j`/`k`/`l` | Resize pane by 5 cells |
| `Alt` + `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` | Switch panes **without prefix** |
| `Alt` + `1`...`9` | Switch to window N **without prefix** |
| `Alt` + `Shift` + `‚Üê`/`‚Üí` | Swap current window position left/right |
